    Coding
  </h1>


  This is my repository for keeping track of little coding challenges that I do. These challenges are currently all done in javascript. The basic process is that I find an idea (or watch a youtube coding challenge) then I try to make the idea in  under an hour.
<br>
  The initial idea will usually be working in 20-30min, however there may be a lot more time spent on some of these to add features or improve visuals etc.

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for challenge in site.challenges %}
      <li>
        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ challenge }}">{{ challenge }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
