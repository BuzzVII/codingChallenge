# Coding

This is my repository for keeping track of little coding challenges that I do. These challenges are currently all done in javascript. The basic process is that I find an idea (or watch a youtube coding challenge) then I try to make the idea in  under an hour.

The initial idea will usually be working in 20-30min, however there may be a lot more time spent on some of these to add features or improve visuals etc.
